# Next.js Routing Error: Unexpected Route Change

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where unexpected route changes lead to errors.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code that attempts to navigate to a non-existent route.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` shows how to correctly handle potential route errors.

## Problem
Attempting to navigate to a route that doesn't exist using the `useRouter` hook's `push` method will result in an unexpected behavior or possibly throw an error on the client-side, leading to an unpleasant user experience.  A more robust approach is required to handle such scenarios gracefully.

## Solution
The solution implements an error boundary or a conditional check to ensure that only valid routes are accessed or that the navigation is handled gracefully if the route is not found.  This approach improves application stability and provides a better user experience.
